### What Data is Deleted?

When you delete your account, the following information is permanently removed from our active databases:

* **Account Credentials:** Your email address and unique Account ID stored via Supabase.
* **Metadata:** Any associated user preferences or profile settings.

### What Data is Kept?

* **Chat History:** Hazle does **not** store your chat logs on our servers. Since this data is stored locally on your
device, it is deleted when you uninstall the app or clear the app's cache.
* **Anonymized Technical Logs:** We may retain anonymized IP logs for up to **12 months** for security and anti-fraud
purposes, after which they are purged.
* **Aggregated Data:** We may keep non-identifiable, aggregated technical data (e.g., crash frequency reports via
Sentry) to improve the app, which cannot be linked back to you.

### Retention Period

* **Active Deletion:** Upon your request, identifiable account data is deleted immediately (In-App) or within 7 days (Email).
* **Automatic Deletion:** To ensure we don't keep unnecessary data, any account that has been inactive for **12 months**
will be automatically deleted from our system.
