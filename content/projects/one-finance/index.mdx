Or just read the features:

#### üíµ Wallet
This is the main page of the app. The wallet's purpose is to show the balance of your physical wallet so you don't have to check it all the time. You have only one actual wallet, so there are no multiple wallets in this app, unlike some apps. Instead, there are multiple accounts. Using the Wallet page you can:
- Add transactions with 2 taps
- Add incomes
- Add expenses with categories
- Optionally choose a category
- Transfer money to your accounts
- Add expenses with just 1 tap from the Quick List
- See 'Today', 'This week' and 'This month' reports
- Tap the balance to edit manually

#### üè¶ Account Manager
You can add multiple accounts to the app and switch between them. The accounts can be your real-life bank accounts or just to manage different kinds of expenses and incomes. You can:
- Switch between accounts with 1 tap
- See all transactions of each account right away
- Add payments directly from accounts
- Transfer money between the accounts

#### üìÉ Transaction History
There's a transaction history page with all your incomes, expenses, deposits, and withdrawals. In this page you can:
- Search and edit transaction amount, description, category, or date
- Filter by date: Today, yesterday, this week, or last week
- Filter by type: Income or expense
- Filter by the category
- Sort by date or amount

#### üìà Investments
You can use the Investments feature to manage and monitor all your investments in one place, with the following features:
- Add invested amounts and return values
- Calculate profit automatically
- Add special notes
- See investment history
- Group similar investments by tags
- Sort investments by most profitable, return value, invested amount, or longest time period

#### ‚ùáÔ∏è Categories
Categories are completely optional because it's a bit of a hassle to decide a category for some people. Or maybe it's just me. However, the point is to make it as quick as possible when adding an expense. You can choose the category later as well. From Categories page:
- Add as many categories as you want
- Choose _any_ color for the categories
- Even choose the transparency level of the color!
- Use the built-in color picker to pick a color easily
- See the spending of each category in a pie chart

#### üìä Reports
You can access Daily, Weekly, and Monthly reports containing the following information:
- Total income and expenses with a chart
- The difference of income and expenses compared to the previous period
- Total budget and the budget left on a simple chart
- Item with the highest expense
- See reports from a specific day

#### ‚öíÔ∏è Tools
One Finance has some extra tools to make your life easier:
- **Shopping cart** to jot down your shopping list. No need to write down lists, lose them, and buy the stuff with memory anymore!
- **Bills** page to paid and due bills. You can add them to your device calendar at the same time, too. You will never forget to pay bills on time again!
- **Loans** page to add borrowed or lent loans. It's rude not to pay back bills on time, isn't it?
- **Calculator** to do basic math because "YoU WoN't HaVe A cALcuLaToR wiTh yOu aLL tHe TiMe"
