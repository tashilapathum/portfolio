This project contains different apps developed for various organizations. The purpose of these types of apps is to pass the defined donation amount to a payment app which is also developed by
PAYable, to be processed as NFC payments. At the time of writing there are 3 apps developed for this functionality. Above is the first app of this kind, WeCare, developed for the welfare of
street dogs and cats. The app offers fixed amounts of donations in both LKR and USD.

        These 'Tap to Donate' type apps were developed by me, leveraging the [Payable SDK](https://www.tashila.me/projects/payable-sdk)
        to communicate with the [payment app](https://www.payable.lk/payable-pro/) running on the POS device, which is also powered by PAYable.
