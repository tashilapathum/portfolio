Fragments are overkill for most use cases. Between the lifecycle issues, the boilerplate, and the constant need for FragmentManager gymnastics, I hit a wall.

I switched to single-activity architecture with Jetpack Navigation + ViewModels scoped to navigation graphs. Itâ€™s cleaner, easier to test, and way less brittle.

If your screen doesn't *need* to be a fragment, don't make it one. Activities or composables (if you're using Compose) are enough.
